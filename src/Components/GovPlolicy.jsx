    <h1>Government Policies and Incentives for Electric Vehicles in India</h1>
        <p>The Government of India is continuously showing its support to develop India as a global leader in the EV sector. 
Several schemes and incentives have been launched by the government to boost the 
demand for electric vehicles as well as motivate manufacturers to invest in the R&D 
of electric vehicles and related infrastructure. The government of India has launched 
so far – FAME-II, PLI SCHEME, and Battery Swapping Policy, Special Electric 
Mobility Zone, Tax Reduction on </p>
<b>Following are the government Policies and incentives for electric vehicles in India. :-
</b><br /><br />

<h3>FAME-II</h3> 
<p> The FAME India initiative was launched on April 1, 2015, by the 
Indian government to reduce the usage of petrol and diesel automobiles. 
This scheme was an essential part of electric mobility in India.
 The FAME India Scheme aims to incentivize all types of vehicles.</p> 
<b>The four focus areas of the Fame India Scheme are as follows:</b>
<ul>
<li> Demand for technology</li>
<li>Pilot Projects</li>
<li> Technology development</li>
<li> Infrastructure for Charging</li>
</ul> 
<p>The FAME II scheme was introduced in April 2019 with a budget outlay of Rs 10,000 crore to support 5,00,000 e-three-wheelers, 7,000 e-buses, 55,000 e-passenger vehicles, and a million e-two-wheelers. The aim was to drive greater adoption of EVs in India. The scheme was supposed to end in 2022. But now, In the budget for FY2022-23, the Government of India has decided to extend the FAME-II scheme till 31 March 2024.

<h3>PLI SCHEME</h3>
<p>In June 2021, The Department of Heavy Industry launched the Production Linked 
Incentive for Advanced Chemistry Cell Battery Storage (PLI-ACC Scheme). 
Its goal is to entice domestic and international investors to invest in India’s 
Giga scale ACC manufacturing facilities. The PLI-ACC Scheme is one of thirteen 
initiatives sanctioned by the Union Government to support the Prime Minister’s 
goal of “Atmanirbhar Bharat.” <br /><br/> The scheme’s overall pay-out is INR 18,100 crore. 
This will be paid across five years after the production facility is operational. 
The policy stipulates that the manufacturing facility must be operational within
 two years to be eligible for subsidies, and the Bid Documents go on to say that a 
60 percent domestic value addition must be achieved within five years after that.<br/><br/>
Many small and mid-sized businesses that manufacture EV batteries and car parts are unable to apply for the scheme’s benefits due to stringent selection requirements. Smaller firms are critical in closing the demand-supply imbalance in the industry. Modifying present standards or proposing a substitute to make the plan a viable choice for these businesses will improve the EV community.
</p>

<h3>Battery Swapping Policy</h3>
<p>The Finance Minister stated that the government intends to introduce a Battery Swapping Policy. This scheme will standardize the standards of batteries to be used in EVs across India.
 The legislation will help in promoting EV’s in time-sensitive service sectors
 like deliveries and inter-city transportation as swapping a drained battery for 
a fully charged one is a more practical option than on-the-spot recharging, 
which can take hours. <br /><br/> This will make interoperability easy. 
If all the batteries are of the same configuration for all the same category of EV, 
buyers need not worry while swapping their batteries and be concerned about the
 configuration of new batteries being put.
<br /><br/>If performed well, battery switching is expected to achieve acceptance in commercial applications such as 2W and 3W vehicles and will aid faster penetration in these segments.

<h3>Special E-mobility Zone</h3>
<p>The government plans to establish dedicated mobility zones for electric vehicles. Only electric vehicles or comparable vehicles will be permitted to operate in the zones identified by the administration. Such policies are prevalent in many European countries and China.
<br/><br/>The hidden benefit of special Electric mobility zones will be that they will help curb overcrowding due to private vehicles. People moving through these zones need to travel in their EV of their own or take a public EV vehicle, thus increasing the market share of EVs.
